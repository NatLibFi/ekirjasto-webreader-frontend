# Core Helpers

The Core package provides various helper functions for common tasks such as creating a breakpoints map, managing focus and keyboard, transforming JS props to CSS custom properties that can be appended to the DOM, and more.

```tsx
import { 
  breakpointsMap, 
  createTocTree, 
  focusUtilities,
  getPlatform,
  keyboardUtilities,
  getSupportedProgressionFormats,
  canRenderProgressionFormat,
  getBestMatchingProgressionFormat,
  propsToCSSVars
} from "@edrlab/thorium-web/core/helpers";
```

TBD.
